        <h2>About Cassandra</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Cassandra of Troy</strong> is a tragic figure from Greek mythology, known for her beauty, intelligence, and her cursed gift of prophecy. Here is her story:
        </p>
        <h3>Cassandra’s Origins</h3>
        <p>
            Cassandra was the daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba of Troy, making her a princess of the city. She was renowned for her extraordinary beauty and grace. However, her life took a dark turn when she caught the attention of the god Apollo.
        </p>
        <h3>The Gift and the Curse</h3>
        <p>
            Apollo, smitten with Cassandra, offered her the gift of prophecy in exchange for her love. Cassandra accepted the gift but later rejected Apollo’s romantic advances. Enraged by her refusal, Apollo could not take back his divine gift, so instead, he cursed her: although she would always speak the truth and foresee the future, no one would ever believe her prophecies.
        </p>
        <h3>Cassandra’s Prophecies</h3>
        <p>
            Cassandra’s cursed gift became her torment. She foresaw many of the tragic events surrounding the Trojan War but was powerless to prevent them.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Paris and Helen:</strong> Cassandra warned against her brother Paris’s journey to Sparta, where he would abduct Helen, the wife of King Menelaus of Sparta. She predicted that this act would bring destruction to Troy. Her warnings were ignored.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Fall of Troy:</strong> When the Greeks left the Trojan Horse at the gates of Troy, Cassandra desperately warned the Trojans not to bring it into the city, declaring that it was a trap. Her cries fell on deaf ears, and the horse was brought inside, leading to Troy’s downfall.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Her Own Fate:</strong> Cassandra foresaw her own capture and death but could do nothing to change her destiny.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cassandra’s Tragic End</h3>
        <p>
            After Troy fell, Cassandra was taken as a war prize by King Agamemnon of Mycenae. She became his concubine, a fate she had also foreseen. Upon their return to Mycenae, Cassandra warned Agamemnon of his impending murder at the hands of his wife, Clytemnestra, and her lover, Aegisthus. Again, her warnings were ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both Cassandra and Agamemnon were killed shortly afterward, fulfilling her tragic prophecy.
        </p>
        <h3>Cassandra as a Symbol</h3>
        <p>
            Cassandra is often seen as a symbol of unheeded truth and the pain of being disbelieved. Her story has resonated through the centuries as a cautionary tale about ignoring wisdom and foresight.
        </p>
        <p>
            In modern contexts, “Cassandra” is sometimes used to describe someone who warns of danger but is ignored until it’s too late.
